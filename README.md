I've previously worked on a blockchain based, hemp distribution tracking application for JarrowTech, [here](https://github.com/Jarrow-Tech/JarrowTech) and on "Tinder for Rock Climbers" at Xplor Adventures LLC as a full stack engineer.

I'm currently learning go to expand my skills on the backend. You can see some of my progress [here](https://open.kattis.com/users/andey-robins).

I'm looking to calloborate on any projects that look to distribute and decentralize the world!
